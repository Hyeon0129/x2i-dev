In the previous guide, we introduced the installation of drivers and the basic environment setup required for Tenstorrent NPU . For detailed instructions, please refer to the Tenstorrent NPU Wormhole N300S Setup Guide.

This guide is divided into three parts to walk you through the installation process of Tenstorrent SDKs.
In this first part, we will cover TT-Buda in detail, focusing on the complete Tenstorrent TT-Buda Installation process.
Subsequent parts will provide step-by-step instructions on installing and using TT-Metalium and TT-Forge, along with practical examples.

In this guide, we will walk you through the installation of Tenstorrent TT-Buda, the high-level AI/ML SDK that compiles and runs models on Tenstorrent hardware.
